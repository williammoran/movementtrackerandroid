This is an app for tracking your location.
It will be primarily be targetted at hikers, but should be usable for joggers as well as anyone else who wants to track where they go.

It has some specific goals:
* Minimal battery use: since other apps out there seem to think it's OK to kill your battery to show you ads and useless app flair. Movement Tracker will attempt to be usable for long hikes that would result in a dead phone battery with other apps.
* Actually useful feedback on your activity: especially for hikers who aren't really concerned about splits, but more about the whole journey.
* Integrate with online apps to create an online hiking community: more on that as development proceeds.

The app is being developed on Youtube, you can follow along here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt2NVIs_msb6MdQUqKLU4K-AoRVC9kKAK
